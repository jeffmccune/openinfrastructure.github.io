Finally got a logo for the company.  It turned out to be pretty easy once I
finally took the plunge and signed up for [fiverr][fiverr]. Fairly inexpensive,
and a quick 5 day turnaround on the design.  I was able to take the original
image files and work with them in [The GNU Image Manipulation Program][gimp].
